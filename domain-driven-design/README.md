# Domain Driven Design

**DDD**A design approach that is driven by domain, not technology

**Domain**

The sphere of knowledge, in problem space

The subject area to which the system belongs to 

Core domain, supporting domain, generic domain

**Model**

Abstractions to describe the domain in solution space

**Context**

The scope in which the model is valid

**Ubiquitous Language**

A language structure around the domain model Used by the team

# DDD Patterns

**Domain Service**

Core for the given bounded context Implements Business Logic

Involves more than one domain object Not CRUD operations

**Application Services**

Entry point to access the domain layer Interface to external consumers

REST layer

**Infrastructure Services**

Generic technical services Email, Queues and etc Typically ready-made services

**Entities**

Identifiable and Mutable

Can be created with minimum requirements

**VO/Value Objects**

No identity, Immutable and interchangeable

Alternative to primitive obsession

**DTO/Data Transfer Object**

Data containers for transport across layers

Hides internal data structures

**Aggregate**

Cluster of objects with an aggregate root

**Repository**

Handles CRUD on Aggregates

Gives an impression of in-memory storage

# Strategic DDD

**Context/Bounded Context**

Packages, Namespaces, Modules Subsystems or Microservices

Specific Teams, Databases, Language

**Continous Integration**

Common code repository Frequent Builds Automated Tests

**Context Map**

Maps different bounded contexts

**Bounded Context Vs Subdomain**

Subdomain belongs to problem

Bounded Context belongs to solution

Multiple bounded-contexts within a given subdomain

**Integration**

Multiple Bounded Contexts 

Legacy Systems 

Third-party Services 

**Integration Strategies**

Shared Kernel: Shared minimal domain model 

Customer/Supplier: Aligned priorities, tasks 

Conformist: At the mercy of third-party 

Anti-Corruption Layer: Translation layer 

Open Host: Services for others to integrate 

Published Language: JSON/XML Messages 

Separate Ways: Letâ€™s not integrate

Final solution may involve multiple strategies
